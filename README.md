# Short-Term SPY ETF Price Forecasting Model

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the short-term high and low prices of the SPY ETF using various machine learning and statistical models. The primary objective is to aid retail traders, particularly day traders, in making informed investment decisions.


##  Data

The project utilizes historical price data and a suite of technical indicators as input for the models. Different Jupyter Notebooks come with their corresponding datasets.


## Models

Several models were implemented and tested in this project:

- Baseline Models:
    - Linear Regression
    - Ridge Regression
    - Lasso Regression

- Advanced Models:
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    - Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

- Time-Series Models:
    - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    - Hidden Markov Models (HMM)


## Notebooks
