# Short Term SPY ETF Prediction
##Project description
As zero-commission investing becomes increasingly popular, many retail traders enter the market. Some of them are day traders. We wish to build a predictive model on the short-term (1 hour or less) high/low prices (or just prices) of the SPY ETF.
